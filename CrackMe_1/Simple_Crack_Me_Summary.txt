Summary of cracking simple crackme's:

   1. Run the program to observe its behaviour
   2. Load the program in DIE/ExePEInfo to analyze the PE
   3. Load the program in x64dbg and reverse the jumps in order
      to avoid showing the "bad message" and instead show the
      "good message"
   4. Search for a proper instruction to patch (usually nops and/or jmps), and assemble
      a new instruction to replace the old instruction.
   5. Patch the file, load the new patch and test
